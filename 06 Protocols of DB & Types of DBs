Protocols in SQL Server:
------------------------
-> SQL Server Network Interface(SNI) is a protocol layer that establishes the network connection between client & Server
-> SQL Server Network Configuration Manager => SQL Server Network Configuration(32bit) => protocols for Jetti Express 
-> to give Permissions => Security=> logins => New Logins => username => What permissions did he got.
-> SQL supports 4 Protocols
       1. Shared memory (Enabled)
       2. Named Pipes (Disabled)
       3.TCP/IP (Disabled)
       4. VIA
       
 1.Shared Memory:
     -> Its a default protocol
     -> connect within the Client(user) & server (within PC)
     
 2.Named pipes: 
     -> Connect within the LAN (Boundaries)we can work
     
 3.TCP/IP:
     -> No Boundaries, We can access the db globally using internet
     -> connect using Ip address & Port Number
     -> Port Number is 1433
     
 4.VIA:
     -> It is a wireless internet protocol for connecting clients & servers within a certin range.

Types of Database: 2types
     -> System Database: 
     -> User Database:  
    
  1. System Database:
     -> It comes with SQL installation (By default) 
     -> In System db it contains 5 databases
             Master db
             model db
             MS db
             Temp db
             Resourse db
             
       Master DB:
         -> Its the Heart of the SQL Server.
         -> All the Login information & configuration information are shown here
         -> Every database needs a backup
         -> server namnes, file locations, collation settings, etc.,
     
       Model DB:
         -> Its a Templete db
         -> Whenever we create a userdb(Andhra, telangana), the requirements(SQL) properties, structure,size of MDF, LDF taken from Model db
         
       MS DB:
         -> All the job level information stored in MS db.
         -> database we need to backup because if the db crashes, the backup we did we can build new dbserver & restore it. the same data gives to user
         -> Our role to maintain backups. we cant backup 1000 servers daily, so that we can create jobs. SQL jobs in that we create backup jobs on Non Business hours
         -> In case if backup fails, we have a Queue (we have a group with dbteam, we get the ticket on so & so serverbackup fails we should check it)
         
      Temp DB:
         -> Stores Temporary objects(data) of the user.
         -> When we runs a query, the informationwill be stored in temp db
         
      Resource DB:
         ->Its a Hidden db
         -> Before 2005, Service pack information was stored
         -> After 2005, All the service pack information stored in resource db for Rollback
         
  2. User Database:
         -> we create a particular database(like Andhra,Telangana etc)
         -> Creation of User db => SSMS -> ServerName(JettiExpress)=> Database => rightclick => New Database => Db name: Hari, Owner: default => it creates 2 files
                                  1. Hari (MDF)
                                  2. Hari_log (LDF)
         -> To see the file location => go to particular db => right click => properties => files => location
                                  C:drive=> program files(x86) => Microsoft Sql server => MSSQL\\JettiExpress => mssql => Data file
  
 How many ways to Start or Stop the SQL Server? -> 3 ways
  -> 1. SQL Services => Start or Stop for Patching the Server
        SQL Server Configuration Manager(SSCM)  => SQL Server name(Jetti Express) => SQL Server => right click => Start or Stop
  -> 2. Services -> SQL Server name(Jetti Express) -> Start or Stop
  -> 3. using Command Prompt (cmd)
