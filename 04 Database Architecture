What is Database?
-> Collection of Master Data File(MDF) and Log Data File(LDF)

What is MDF?
-> Master Data file(MDF) stores Permanemt Data. Eg: Adhar card

What is LDF?
-> Log Data File(LDF) is a Temporary Data
-> If we run queries in the server i.e, any transaction, 1st it goes to temporary data(LDF) works here & data info commits here then brings information from MDF

How Database works?
     
     Master Data File(MDF)--------------------Log Data File(LDF)
               |                                      |
               |                                      |
               ---------------BUFFER-------------------

-> we can't do any modifications (like update,insert, etc) directly in MDF
-> MDF stores the Permanent data in pages (1 page = 8kb) 
-> the page will copy to BUFFER
-> Modifications are done in buffer and sends to LDF
-> LDF validates the data (like replace or update the data) 
-> After that it Commits user through Checkpoint
-> Checkpoint is a internal mechanism, once data commits the LDF will forward into MDF (it stores permanently)

Which architecture does SQL Database follows?
-> SQL Server follows Client-Server Architecture
-> we are running SQL(Child) on Windows Server(Parent)
